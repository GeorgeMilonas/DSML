# Data Science / Machine Learning

For this Python project, the goal is to implement classes that can be
called from the main function to simplify the process of DS/ML tasks.


# Folder Structure
<pre> ```plaintext DSML/ ├── src/ # reusable modules and classes ├── notebooks/ # exploration, EDA, or examples ├── data/ # datasets or download scripts ├── models/ # saved models ├── tests/ # unit tests ├── requirements.txt # dependencies ├── README.md # project description └── LICENSE # licensing information ``` </pre>


## Workflow

1. Data Processing – Clean, transform, and prepare data for analysis.

2. Visualization – Explore data using visual tools to identify trends and patterns.

3. Model Selection / Forecasting – Choose appropriate models and generate forecasts based on the data.
