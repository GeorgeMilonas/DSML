# Data Science / Machine Learning

For this Python project, the goal is to implement classes that can be
called from the main function to simplify the process of DS/ML tasks.


# Folder Structure
<pre> ```plaintext DSML/ ├── src/ – Reusable modules and classes ├── notebooks/ – Exploratory notebooks, EDA, examples ├── data/ – Datasets or data download scripts ├── models/ – Saved models (e.g., `.pkl`, `.pt`) ├── tests/ – Unit tests ├── requirements.txt – List of dependencies ├── pyproject.toml – (Optional) Project configuration ├── README.md – Project overview and instructions └── LICENSE – Licensing information ``` </pre>


## Workflow

1. Data Processing – Clean, transform, and prepare data for analysis.

2. Visualization – Explore data using visual tools to identify trends and patterns.

3. Model Selection / Forecasting – Choose appropriate models and generate forecasts based on the data.
